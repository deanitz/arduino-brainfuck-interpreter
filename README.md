# arduino-brainfuck-interpreter
Turns Arduino Uno into a [Brainfuck](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) editor and interpreter, a brainteaser for programmers.

Based on this [sketch](https://github.com/Lepeshka92/Arduino-Brainfuck-Machine) with several small fixes and improvements.

Works well with LCD Keypad Shield, however maybe need to review it's original sketch for other sets of button signal shift.
